These helper functions will be used in the next assignment to build a two-layer neural network and an L-layer neural network. Each small helper function you will implement will have detailed instructions that will walk you through the necessary steps. Here is an outline of this assignment, you will:\n",
    "\n",
    "Initialize the parameters for a two-layer network and for an LL-layer neural network.\n",
    "Implement the forward propagation module (shown in purple in the figure below).\n",
    "Complete the LINEAR part of a layer's forward propagation step (resulting in Z[l]Z[l]).\n",

    "Implement the backward propagation module (denoted in red in the figure below).\n",

This assignment will show you exactly how to carry out each of these steps.\n",
