    "    - assume f_k(x,mu_k,sigma) are Gaussian with the same variance\n",
    "    - the max of p_k(x) in k <=> the max of discriminant functions in k that is linear in x, which still depends on mu_k, sigma and pi_k\n",
    "    - need estimate pi_k, mu_k and sigma from X and Y\n",

    "    - Once have k for given x, we can compute p_k(x) for the probability\n",

    "    - Quatratic: f_k(x) are Gaussian having different covariance\n",
    "    - Naive Bayes: X are independent in each class (covariance matrix is diagonal); useful for large p; useful for mixed feature vectors\n",
