    "- there is no simple goal\n",
    "- hard to assess as there is no labeled data and thus CV cannot be performed\n",

    "1. PCA\n",
    "- transform p features into M components\n",
    "- find normalized principle component loading vector for each M component\n",
    "    - scale each p feature to have 0 mean\n",
    "    - first component: find its loading vector that maximize the sample variance\n",
    "    - other component 1-by-1 in order: find its loading vector maximizing the sample variance and othorgonal to the previous loading vector\n",
    "- principle component score: defined by using loading vectors and sample, which can be treated as new observation for M components\n",
    "- Biplot: show score with respect to the first two components, and the first two loading vectors in terms of p features\n",
    "- principal components provide low-dimensional linear surfaces that are closest to the observations\n",
    "    - the first component is the line in p-dimensional space that is closest to the n observations\n",
    "- proportion of variance explained (PVE): to measure how much of the variance in the data is not contained in the first few components\n",
    "    - scree plot or cumulative PVE\n",
    "- How many components to use? No simple solution for unsupervised learning\n",
    "    - typically decide by eyeballing the elbow in the scree plot\n",
    "    - in practice, if no interesting patterns are found in the first few principal components, then further principal components are unlikely to be of inter- est. Conversely, if the first few principal components are interesting, then we typically continue to look at subsequent principal components until no further interesting patterns are found.\n",

    "    - Initialize: random assign each observation to one of the K clusters\n",

    "        - Compute the centroid (mean) for each of the K clusters (gives the total WCV)\n",
